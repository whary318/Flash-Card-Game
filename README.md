This is a simple Flash card game where the player matches the creature's name to the picture.
The game consists of pictures and 4 options with one representing the picture.

This project is part of my web design course.

### Version 2 (PHP Version)

#### What you will need
* A server side software to run the PHP pages (or any other means to do so). I recommend using XAMPP
* A MySQL server to run the script in. XAMPP comes with a MySQL server in case you end up using it.
* You will need a way to run the script. Here are two ways you could do it.
   *  Use the PHPMyAdmin page and go the SQL page. you can enter the script there.
   *  Or you could use a standalone software such as MySQL Workbench

#### How to setup
* Have the needed software installed.
* Go to Releases, select "PHP version" and download the "Source code (zip)". 
* Navigate to where you installed XAMPP and then open "htdocs" folder.
* Unzip the files into the "htdocs" folder.
* Open the PHPMyAdmin page and navigate to SQL tab. 
* upload the .sql file and excute.
now you can simply open the webpage in your browser using "localhost".
